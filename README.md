# Unwanted extensions

This extensions, tries to help out with extensions which are not recommended for specific workspaces.

## ‚ÜóÔ∏èSuccessor

This is the continuation of the previous extension [Unwanted Recommendations](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GARAIOAG.garaio-vscode-unwanted-recommendations) which is not maintained anymore.  
The extension therefore had to be migrated to a new publisher.

## üìñ Blog post

I have written a more complete blog post about the whole topic and this extension, [üëÄ read it here](https://www.garaio.com/blog/vscode-extensions-unwanted-recommendations)

## üöß Details / Situation

Until now, it seems not to be possible to automate enabling or disabling extensions per project/workspace.  
The VSCode Team introduced **profiles**, which went into a good direction and might be the solution in the future for that.  

But still, there seem to be issues or unsupported details, like

* **Deprecating** specific extensions for a workspace
* Also handling **SemVer** with extensions is a topic

Until then, its not easy to handle it. This extension tries to improve the experience for developers.

## üß© Features

### Define unwanted extensions in extensions.json

This extension allows you to put unwanted extensions, into the already existing `.vscode/extensions.json` file, which already seems to kind of support the property `unwantedRecommendations`. Simply put your vscode extension id's in this array.

Following is a possible example for using **`Volar`**, and check for disabled `Vetur`, `Typescript Vue Plugin` amd `(@builtin) Typescript Language Features`:

```json
{
    "recommendations": [
        "vue.volar"
    ],
    "unwantedRecommendations": [
        "vscode.typescript-language-features",
        "octref.vetur",
        "vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin"
    ]
}
```

> Note: This extension is only handling the `unwantedRecommendations`, as the `recommendations` are already handled by **VSCode**.

### üÜïDefine extensions version numbers to exclude from this workspace

If you want to mark a specific version or range of versions as deprecated for your workspace, you can now add the unwanted extensions to the following file, including the semver version range:

Create a file `.vscode/extensionsVersionCheck.json`, or if you need comments in there, use `.jsonc`.

```jsonc
{
    "recommendations": [],
    "unwantedRecommendations": [
        // Mention the extension id and the version you want to use, its enough to have 1 single definition.
        // However you can also mention the same extension id multiple times with different versions if you preffer.
        // We will report only the last matching rule which matches with the installed extension's version.
        // 
        // Exact version: You can specify an exact version like 1.0.0.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@0.1.0",
        // Greater than or equal to: You can specify a version greater than or equal to a certain version using >=, like >=1.0.0.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@>=0.1.1",
        // Less than: You can specify a version less than a certain version using <, like <2.0.0.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@<0.2.0",
        // Hyphen Ranges: You can specify a range of versions using -, like 1.0.0 - 2.0.0. This would include versions greater than or equal to 1.0.0 and less than or equal to 2.0.0.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@0.1 - 0.9",
        // Wildcard Ranges: You can specify a range of versions using *, like 1.0.* or 1.*. This would include all versions that start with 1.0. or 1. respectively.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@0.*",
        // Tilde Ranges: You can specify a range of versions using ~, like ~1.0.0. This would include all versions >=1.0.0 and <1.1.0.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@~0.1.0",
        // Caret Ranges: You can specify a range of versions using ^, like ^1.0.0. This would include versions >=1.0.0 and <2.0.0.
        "formulahendry.auto-complete-tag@^0.1.0"
    ]
}
```

> The above are all just examples, you should only need to define 1 rule.  
> However you can feel free to add multiple rules per extension if you need to.  
> There will be maximum 1 notification per extension.  
> If you save it as `.json`, make sure to remove all the comments.

### üÜï Logs

You can check the logs if you need more details, what is happening during the checks: `VSCode->OUTPUT->Unwanted extensions`

## üóíÔ∏è What does this extension do

* When opening the folder/workspace, this extension will *automatically* run if the `.vscode/extensions.json` (or `.vscode/extensionsVersionCheck.json`) file exists.
* If there are any `unwantedRecommendations`, it will go through them and check if the `extension` is enabled.
* It will consider the defined version number as SEMVER, if no version number is defined, it will just look for the extension
* If the extension is **enabled**, (and the version number matches) it will show a warning message including an info to disabled the extension manually.
* After all extensions are checked, a popup will ask to show all extensions in the extension-gallery.

After the user disabled manually all unwanted extensions, the workspace should be configured as wanted, even after restarts/reboots the extensions will not get enabled automatically. (until you manually enable them again)

<!-- For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow. -->

## üñºÔ∏è Screenshots

### If `unwantedRecommendations` are defined

1. When opening a project, this extension checks all configured `unwantedRecommendations` and reports the still enabled extensions:

1. After click "yes" on the provided popup, it will bring you to the extensions, to disable them manually: (list will be already filtered to the specific extensions)

1. You / the user can now disable the extensions manually - preferably using the **Disable (Workspace)** action

1. On the next restart/reload of vscode, the extension will check again and notify that all is fine (if all `unwantedRecommendations`-extensions are disabled)

### No unwanted extensions defined

Further when there is no extension defined as `unwantedRecommendations`, this extension will show the following information:

1. When manually checking using the **command** (see below) and no `extensions.json` file exist:

1. No `unwantedRecommendations` configured within `extension.json`

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the check manually

This extensions runs automatically when you open your project including the `.vscode/extensions.json`
You can also execute the check manually, using the vscode **command**

* `Check for unwanted extensions`

## ‚ùó Requirements

`.vscode/extensions.json` should contain the list of unwanted extensions within the `unwantedRecommendations` property. See above for details.

### Version numbers

Version numbers are only supported within the `.vscode/extensionsVersionCheck.json` file.

### Workspaces / Multi-root workspaces

You can use the above approach if you are running a workspace.
Just place the `.vscode/extensions.json` file into your workspace root directory.

Alternatively you can also put the unwanted extensions within your `***.code-workspace` file.

```json
{
 "extensions": {
  "unwantedRecommendations": [
   "octref.vetur",
  ]
 }
}
```

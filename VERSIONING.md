# Versioning of this extensions

<https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#prerelease-extensions>

Make sure that pre-releases have separate version numbers, like 1.1 / 1.3 etc.
Real releases should stick to 1.2 / 1.4 etc.

VSCODE extensions only support x.y.z, not SEMVER! (-alpha)

Make sure to use the right command for prerelease!
